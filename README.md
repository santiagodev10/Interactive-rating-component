## Overview
This is a challenge of a simple component that allows the user to submit a rating from 1 to 5.
### The challenge
Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- BEM methodology
- JavaScript
- DOM manipulation

### What i learned 
The main thing that i learned with this challenge was to work with forms and handling user interactions. Even though this form would not be submitting the rating to a server (in a real enviroment it would) instead of that it just change the card because the challenge was about that, but i understand how to implement a form to send the data to a real server. I also improve in DOM manipulation and basic programming logic to solve the challenge of changing the card with the number that the user choose when he submitted a rating.

### Continued development
I want to continue improving my programming logic in more difficult challenges, that helps me to apply more techniques i`ve been researching. I also need to keep practicing my layout markup in HTML.

### Useful resources
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/) - The old reliable guide for begginers and expirienced developers never fails to me.
